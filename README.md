# Weather Prediction Classification

This project implements various machine learning models to predict weather conditions based on historical meteorological data from Australia.

## Overview

The notebook uses a dataset containing daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. It implements and compares the following classification algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Features

- Data preprocessing including one-hot encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics calculation (Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, MAE, MSE, R2, LogLoss)
- Comparative analysis of different models

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Results

The notebook provides a comprehensive comparison of different models' performance on the weather prediction task. Refer to the final table in the notebook for detailed metrics.
